## 🔬 Technical Implementation

### SMC Analysis (`smc_analyzer.py`)
```python
# Detect Break of Structure
bos_signals = analyzer.detect_bos(swing_highs, swing_lows, closes)

# Find Order Blocks
order_blocks = analyzer.detect_order_blocks(price_data)

# Identify Liquidity Zones
liquidity_zones = analyzer.find_liquidity_zones(highs, lows)
```

### Deep Learning Ensemble (`deep_learning_models.py`)
```python
# Train all models
ensemble.train_models(historical_data, epochs=50)

# Get predictions
predictions = ensemble.predict(recent_data)
signal = ensemble.get_ensemble_signal(predictions)
```

### Enhanced Environment (`enhanced_trading_env.py`)
```python
# Comprehensive market analysis
market_analysis = env._analyze_market()

# Smart action execution
reward = env._execute_action(action, market_analysis)
```
